This is a simple light weight python wrapper for the free counter api - https://countapi.xyz/

## What is countapi?
I was working on a telegram bot which I was going to host on Heroku. Since Heroku doesn't provide any sort of persistent storage on the dynos, I had only one option to use some sort of cloud database, like firebase, mongoDB, or heroku's PostgreSQL, etc. But my task was just store simple count of my bot usages. I don't need to maintain a database for that!
After a little bit of research, I got this free counter api, exactly what I wanted.
To make life easier, I implemented this beginner friendly and easy wrapper for the counter api.
